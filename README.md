# # LFW (The Luna Framework) - Visualization (Bubble Sort Algorithm)

# Disclaimer

This demo was written with an old version of the API and has been changed alot since then.
The functionality reached from main.cpp is working the same way.


# How To Get Started

Download the project and run the Setup.bat. Start the generated .sln and run!
Use the settings to control the amount of "pillars" and when to sort them (including a reset button).
